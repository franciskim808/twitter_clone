# Project title
Gritter, a Grep-Team Twitter clone.

# Team members' names
Jason Weidner, Aaron Shyuu, Michael Shippee, Francis Kim

# Vision statement
We aim to build a simple Twitter clone called Gritter (Twitter by the Grep Team).

In the app users will be able to:
- read from a public feed, 
- tweet to their own feed, which also adds content to the public feed,
- browse the feeds of other users,
- 'follow' other users (i.e. generate a feed for 'following') 
- 'like' tweets, 
- reply to tweets
- retweet tweets by others, and 
- delete their own tweets.

Users will not be able to edit their own tweets. And tweets will be limited to 240 characters in length.

Our motto is "We all have a voice in the public square.".

# Motivation
Our motivation for the project is to build an approachable technical project that is a sign of the times. 

Additionally, Gritter is a relatively simple app that has features sophisticated enough to meet project objectives. It would require development of several different database tables, with relationships between each. It would have a backend and front-end and lends itself to development using an agile approach, which is important to the team. 

Moreover, Gritter is easy to explain to new users and developers examining project results. Furthermore, Gritter can be a good discussion point in technical interviews later on.

Lastly, if built well, Gritter can serve as a platform for future project work where students can implement data science-like features that allow users to filter out unwanted content (whether it be from spam farms, automation, or topics that do not interest).

# Risks to project completion
- Accomodating the skills across the team
- Navigating large time zone differences
- Managing technical scope to be achievable

# Risk Mitigations
## Managing technical scope to be achievable
- Use of Scrum to manage progress, challenges/hurdles, stories
- Use Trello to track stories and progress

## Navigating large time zone differences
- Leverage Slack/email for asynchronous communication
- Plan meetings (Zoom) at mutually achievable time
- Use github to asynchronously managing the code base: https://github.com/jasonweidner/twitter_clone
- Use Scrum to facilitate progress with asynchronous work
- Two out of four team members are located in US time zone while two are located in Asia/Pacific region - may be possible to progress around the clock. 

## Accomodating the skills across the team
- Choose a technology stack that is as simple as possible but not simpler than what is needed
- Choose a technology stack that leverages the interests and existing skills of the team
- Choose a project concept that is as simple as possible but not simpler than what is needed to meet project objectives
- Distribute components among team members according to their knowledge, skill and previous experience.

# Development method
We will use a Scrum process with 3 week sprints, with standups weekly. While 1 week between standups is a long time, we will be sure to communicate with one another asynchronously to overcome roadblocks. At the end of the sprint we will review the progress for each sprint with a sprint retrospective, even if briefly, to assess sprint sizing and story definitions going forward. These reviews may occur asynchronously to accomodate the global distribution of team members.

# Project Tracking Software 
We will be using Trello to track stories, sprints and a story backlog. In the first meeting, we elected Aaron as the Scrum Master for backlog management. All code will be managed through a collaborative, public, github repo.
