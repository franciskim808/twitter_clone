#Project title
Gritter, a Grep-Team Twitter clone.

#Team members' names
Jason Weidner, Aaron Shyuu, Michael Shippee, Francis Kim

#Vision statement
We all have a voice in the public square.

#Motivation
An approachable technical project that is a sign of the times.

Additionally, Gritter is a relatively simple app that has features sophisticated enough to meet project objectives. It would require development of several different database tables, with relationships between each. It would have a backend and front-end. Moreover, Gritter is easy to explain to new users or developers examining project results. Lastly, Gritter can be a good discussion point in technical interviews later on.

#Risks to project completion
- Accomodating the skills across the team
- Navigating large time zone differences
- Managing technical scope to be achievable

#Risk Mitigations
##Managing technical scope to be achievable
- Use of Scrum to manage progress, challenges/hurdles, stories
- Use Trello to track stories and progress

##Navigating large time zone differences
- Leverage Slack/email for asynchronous communication
- Plan meetings (Zoom) at mutually achievable time
- Use github to asynchronously managing the code base: https://github.com/jasonweidner/twitter_clone
- Use Scrum to facilitate progress with asynchronous work

##Accomodating the skills across the team
- Choose a technology stack that is as simple as possible but not simpler than what is needed
- Choose a technology stack that leverages the interests and existing skills of the team
- Choose a project concept that is as simple as possible but not simpler than what is needed to meet project objectives

#Development method
We will use a Scrum process with 1 week sprints. While 1 week sprints are short for development cycles, they will support a more collaborative work experience. One team member has voiced concerns about limited web development experience, while others have mentioned experience with non-web development technology stacks. 
Additionally, we will review the progress for each sprint, even if briefly, to assess sprint sizing and story definitions going forward. These reviews may occur asynchronously to accomodate the global distribution of team members.

#Project Tracking Software 
We will be using Trello to track stories, sprints and a story backlog. In the first meeting we elected Aaron as the Scrum Master for backlog management. All code will be managed through a collaborative, public, github repo.
