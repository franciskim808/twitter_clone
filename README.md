#Project title
Gritter, a Grep-Team Twitter clone.

#Team members' names
Jason Weidner, Aaron Shyuu, Michael Shippee, Fancis Kim

#Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers?
We all have a voice in the public square.

#Motivation: why are you working on this project?
An approachable technical project that is a sign of the times.

Additionally, a Twitter clone is relatively simple app that has features sophisticated enough to meet project objectives. It would require development of several different database tables, with relationships between each. It would have a backend and front-end. Moreover, a Twitter clone is easy to explain to new users or developers examining project results. Lastly, a Twitter clone can be a good disucssion point in technical interviews later on.

#Risks to project completion
Risks might include: 
- new language or working environment
- no prior experience working with these team members
- lack of some needed resources
##Risks
- accomodating the skills across the team
- navigating large time zone differences
- managing technical scope to be achievable

#Mitigation Strategy for above risks
##Managing technical scope to be achievable
- Use of Scrum to manage progress, challenges/hurdles, stories
- 
##Navigating large time zone differences
- Leverage Slack for asynchronous communication
- Plan meetings at mutually achievable time
- 
##Accomodating the skills across the team
- Choose a technolgoy stack that is as simple as possible but not simpler than what is needed
- Choose a technology stack that leverages the interests and existing skills of the team
- Choose a project concept that is as simple as possible but not simpler than what is needed to meet project objectives
 
#Development method
##scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!
We will use a scrum process with 1 week sprints. While 1 week sprints are short for development cycles, they will help support individuals experiencing hurdles. One team member has voiced concerns about limited web development experience, while others have mentioned experience with non-web development technology stacks.

#Project Tracking Software 
We will be using Trello to track stories, sprints and a story backlog. In the first meeting we will establish teh Scrum Master for backlog management. All code will be managed through a collaborative, public, github repo.
